### Tracking campus events can be difficult and time-consuming. Physical flyers often clutter bulletin boards and can be hard to find. Manual entry of event details into a personal calendar is prone to errors. With that in mind, the primary goal of FlyerScan is to simplify the process of tracking on-campus events for students. By automating the extraction of event details from flyers, students can easily add events to their personal calendars and stay informed about upcoming activities. The project aims to satisfy the following criteria:

- Accounts for usersâ€™ needs and requirements
- Requires software development
- Uses a machine learning or recognition component
- Builds interaction techniques

## Implemented Features:
- Able to scan a flyer and determine it is a flyer
- Able to extract date, time, location, and event from the flyer
- Generate calendar file from the information pulled from the flyer
- Review screen with final event information and option for manual correction with keyboard or voice dictation
- History of past scans stored in database
- User Account management
- Responsive design
